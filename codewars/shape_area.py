#
# Create different shapes that can be part of a sortable list. The sort order is based on the size of their respective areas:
# The area of a Square is the square of its side
# The area of a Rectangle is width multiplied by height
# The area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height divided by 2
# The area of a Circle is the square of its radius multiplied by Ï€
# The area of a CustomShape is given
